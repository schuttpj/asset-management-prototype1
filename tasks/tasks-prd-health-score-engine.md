### Notes

- Each task includes mandatory testing and validation steps before proceeding
- Unit tests should be run after each code implementation: `pytest src/[module]/[file]_test.py -v`
- Integration tests validate end-to-end functionality: `pytest tests/integration/ -v`
- Jupyter notebooks provide interactive validation and visual confirmation
- **CRITICAL:** No task should be considered complete until tests pass and validation confirms expected behavior
